# About Ladder
Ladder is an Open Platform for accessible information for kids and young adults. This is a project of the [Open Source for equality](https://www.oseq.org/), it is a global initiative to promote the development and use of free and open source software that bridges gender gap.
	Ladder WebApp was built to make audio information accessible to marginalized populations using urls(hostedsitelink.com) and using Qr Codes.
	It was built using the [wom.fm](https://github.com/OSEQorg/WOM.fm-Sandbox) template, which is also based on the open source [Amplitude.js](https://521dimensions.com/open-source/amplitudejs/docs)  JavaScript library which included the main functionality needed to build Ladder webApp.
